The equlibration of the CG PMMA is done through three steps.
1. generation.in - Initially a soft potential is turned on to remove any kind of overlapping. After that consecutive NPT ensembles are used to equilibrate the density of the system at high pressure and tmeperature.
2. equilibrium_restart.in - Multiple long NVT cycles with truncated LJ potential are used to extend polymer chains.
3. equilibrium_restart_1.in -  Multiple long NVT cycles with full LJ potential are used to extend polymer chains.

Note - MSID of the polymer chains are used to establish adequate equilibration.
